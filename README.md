[ERC-7812](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7812) describes a singleton registry system that stores private provable statements. These can be anything from ZK identity to private attestations, leveraging the shared state and simplified interoperability. Developers may implement custom registrars that carry out business use cases and easily plug them into the system.
